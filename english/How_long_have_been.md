# How long have you (been)...?
We use the present perfect (especially with how long, for, and since) to talk about something that began in the past and continues to the present time.

* He has been in the hospital since Monday.
* Have you known each other for a long time?
* She's been waiting all morning.
* How long have they had their car?

When we ask or say "how long," the continuous is more common.

* I've been studying English for six months
* It's been raining since lunchtime.
* Richard has been doing the same job for 20 years.

know/like/belive etc.. are not normally used in the continuous.

* How long have you known Emily?
* I've had a stomachache all day.

You can use either present perfect continuous or simple with live and work.

* John has been living / has lived in Montreal for a long time.
* How long have you been working / have you worked here?

But we use the simple with always

* Have you always lived in the country?

We say "I haven't done something since/for ..."

* I haven't seen Tom since Monday. (= Monday was the last time I saw him)
* Sue hasn't called for ages. (= The last time she called was ages ago)
